aries_askar-0.4.3-py3-none-manylinux2014_x86_64.whl is consistent with
the following platform tag: "manylinux_2_34_x86_64".

The wheel references external versioned symbols in these
system-provided shared libraries: libm.so.6 with versions
{'GLIBC_2.29'}, libgcc_s.so.1 with versions {'GCC_4.2.0', 'GCC_3.0',
'GCC_3.3'}, libc.so.6 with versions {'GLIBC_2.3', 'GLIBC_2.18',
'GLIBC_2.3.4', 'GLIBC_2.34', 'GLIBC_2.33', 'GLIBC_2.16',
'GLIBC_2.2.5', 'GLIBC_2.4', 'GLIBC_2.14', 'GLIBC_2.9', 'GLIBC_2.3.2',
'GLIBC_2.17', 'GLIBC_2.32', 'GLIBC_2.25', 'GLIBC_2.28', 'GLIBC_2.7'}

This constrains the platform tag to "manylinux_2_34_x86_64". In order
to achieve a more compatible tag, you would need to recompile a new
wheel from source on a system with earlier versions of these
libraries, such as a recent manylinux image.
